### <a name="section_pitch"></a>Pitch

SDVoter's Voice intends to provide a transparent, non-partisan platform so voters can review political campaign contributions, expenditures and voting records for San Diego elected officials.

This project has been forked from [CA civic lab](https://github.com/caciviclab) OpenDisclosure.

### <a name="section_goal"></a>Goal

- Initial goal: Deploy website gathering data from San Diego officials
- Secondary goal: Update features for better insights into data as well as create a comparison feature
- Tertiary goal: Let the public know that the website exists
